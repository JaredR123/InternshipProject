# InternshipProject

This is the version of the project I created with the reward function being utilized.  "adversarial_search.py.html" and "main.py.html" are the files that contain all my code for the project as of Monday night. As I said in our meeting, this version of the program led to many crashing errors, so the current version of the project from Tuesday onwards has eliminated the reward function entirely to maintain stability.
