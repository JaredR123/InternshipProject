# InternshipProject

This project includes several attempted adversarial search implementations with a rudimentary version of the game Frogger. The current version somewhat works with the frog always attempting to optimize its path across the road, however the other version of the project (the files specified by the "old" suffix) includes a reward function that is meant to take a more standard and appropriate reinforcement learning approach. That version of the project is currently unstable and so is marked as "old" to distinguish it from the current, stable version of the project.
